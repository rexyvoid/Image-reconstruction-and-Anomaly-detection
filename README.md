# Image-reconstruction-and-Anomaly-detection

CNN autoencoder is trained on the MNIST numbers dataset for image reconstruction. Anomaly detection is carried out by calculating the Z-score. The Machine Learning framework used is Keras.

# Autoencoders

An autoencoder is a special type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output. An
autoencoder first encodes the image into a lower
dimensional latent representation, then decodes the
latent representation back to an image. An
autoencoder learns to compress the data while
minimizing the reconstruction error.
